# UdonAntiCheat

## Basic Anti-Cheat for VRChat Worlds


### Features:
- Anti Speed
- Anti Avatar Dashing


### Requirements:
- UdonSharp


### Setup:
Attach the UdonAntiCheat component to an object of your choice
- For the speed limit, use the maximum movement speed multiplied by 2


### Planned Features:
- Anti Fly
- Anti Playspace

(I'm planning to continue working on this once I require new features for my worlds)


### Current Issues:
- VRC Client Simulator appears to accelerate the player too much, causing the anti-cheat to activate
